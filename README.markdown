## Intro

The [S5 (Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System)](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/)
templates bundled up into 
a Slide Show (S9) template pack including
three S5 themes, that is, Blue, I18N and Pixel.



Note, the S5 Themes package is configured to use the
following headers in `slides.html.erb`:

    theme: blue    # change as needed values include default|blue|i18n|pixel
    author: Your Name Here
    company: Your Company Here
    title: Your Slide Show Title Here
    subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
    footer: Your Footer Here
    subfooter: Your Subfooter Here

Use the `theme` header to choose your S5 theme. Packaged themes include
`default`, `blue`, `i18n` and `pixel`.
 
 
## Try It Yourself - How To Use the S5 Themes Template Pack

If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow install s5themes

Or as an alternative clone the template pack using `git`. Issue the commands:

    $ cd ~/.slideshow/templates
    $ git clone git://github.com/slideshow-s9/slideshow-s5-themes.git

To check if the new template got installed, use the `list` command:

    $ slideshow list

Listing something like:

    Installed templates include:
       s5themes (~/.slideshow/templates/s5themes/s5themes.txt)

Tip: To get started use the welcome quick starter sample. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow new

Now you will have a copy of the `welcome.text` Quick Starter sample
in Markdown in your working folder.
